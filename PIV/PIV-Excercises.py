#1 Magnification is 0.1 as the physical object is 10 times the size of the image on the sensor

#2 particle is 10 muM therefor the image of the particale is 1 muM. With the pixel pitch of 5 mu M the image is 1%5 of the pixel.

#3 Diffranction limited spo

F = 1*10**(-5)/(2.44 * (1+0.1)*5.32*10**(-7))
print(F)

#F nummeret skal v√¶re F/8
