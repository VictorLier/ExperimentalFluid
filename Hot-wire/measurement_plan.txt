1) First calibration (subgroup 1)
2) Take a small selection of point measurements to get an idea of the flow (subgroup 2)
3) Take measurements at valve exit (subgroup 1)
4) Take measurements at 7D (8/2+3) from exit (subgroup 2)
5) Introduce object at take measurements behind such object to conduct spectrum analysis. (subgroup 1)
6) Perform calibration again and confirm conditions has not been altered. (subgroup 2)
