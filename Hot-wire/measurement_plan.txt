1) First calibration (subgroup 1)
2) Take a small selection of point measurements.
The nuzzle exit velocity is set at 10 m/s.
Two at the centerline with distance 0.1D and 7D and one at 7D with a distance of 1D from centerline. (subgroup 2)

With a measuremnt frequency of 50 Hz and a total time of 2 sec. (100 independent samples) - 1% accuracy
1 kHz anti-aliasing filter of 1 kHz

3) Take measurements at valve exit (subgroup 1)
With the same measurement settings subgroup 1 will measure the velocity profile at 0.1 D from the nozzle.

With 7 equally spaced measurements from -0.6D to 0.6D

Should be centerline, inside and oustide the shearlayer

4) Take measurements at 7D (8/2+3) from exit (subgroup 2)
With 9 equally spaced measurements from -1.5D to 1.5D

If the velocity at the most extreme is still a realitively high velocity (Higher than 10% of centerline velocity) more measurement points is added

Should be centerline, inside and oustide the shearlayer

5) Introduce object at take measurements behind such object to conduct spectrum analysis. 

Measurement frequency is 1.5 kHz with Anti-aliasing filter of 3 kHz and a total time of 1002 seconds.

The cylindrical rod is introduced at a distance of 0.5D from the nozzle exit.

Subgroup 1 places the hotwire with a distance of 1D from nozzle exit

Subgroup 2 places the hotwire with a distance of 5D from nozzle exit.

Both groupes makes a measurement with and without the cylinder in place.

6) Perform calibration again and confirm conditions has not been altered. (subgroup 2)
